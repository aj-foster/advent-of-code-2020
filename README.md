# Advent of Code 2020

This repository contains my solutions for several
[Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) challenges. Initial solutions are often
developed with speed in mind (speed of coding, not efficiency of the code) and usually follow a
"whatever comes to mind first" approach. Revisions, if they occur, attempt to clean it up and
work towards better practices.
